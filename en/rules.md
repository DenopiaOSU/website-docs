<h4 class="cenetered">Rules are changed periodically to adapt to the player landscape.</h4>

<h3><i class="game icon"></i> General rules</h3>

#### _Any violation of the rules in this section will result in a **restriction or ban, temporary or permanent**, depending on the gravity._

1. **Cheating and hacking** is strictly prohibited with the exceptions having the permission of higher staff.
2. **Edited clients** that give players an unfair advantage are not allowed under any circumstances.
3. **Client patching** (instead of using the switcher) is allowed.
4. **Shared or boosted** accounts are not allowed and will be punished according to our multiaccounting policy.
5. **Exploiting vunerabilities** for a malicious reason is bannable. You will be better off reporting it to the developer or owner team.
6. **Inappropeate usernames** will be automatically changed and you may be punished with a silence.
7. **Don't abuse our patience;** while we try to best satisfy our users' need, if you repeatedly infringe our rules or abuse services provided by the staff (e.g. appealing and name changing) (with particular regard to users who also disrespect our staff's efforts, passively or actively, or are otherwise toxic within the community), we will first warn you, and if it comes to it we will offer an ultimatum. If you refuse or otherwise don't change your behaviour, we'll have no choice but to ban you.

<h3><i class="user icon"></i> Profile rules</h3>

#### _Any violation of the rules in this section will result in a **silence and userpage/avatar reset**._

1. **NSFW and offensive** avatars/userpage contents are not allowed.
2. Don't link to **illegal stuff**/porn/warez/viruses on userpages.
3. Do not use **offensive custom badges** and do not **pretend to be someone else with your custom badge**. If you abuse the badges system, you'll be silenced and you won't be able to edit your custom badge anymore.
4. Keep your profile backgrounds SFW. Abusing your supporter benefits will lead to a removal of supporter from your account without a refund.

<h3><i class="file text outline icon"></i> Cheating and Multiaccounting Policy</h3>

#### _This is how we handle the bad guys at RealistikOsu!_

**Cheating Punishments**
Cheating now uses a 3 strike system.

**1st time:** 1 month long restriction + wipe of the cheated gamemodes
**2nd time:** 3 month restriction + full wipe of the account
**3rd time:** Permanent but appealable ban

**Multiaccounting**
Multiaccounting adopts a similar system to cheating. Every single time will result with the permanent ban of the multiaccount.

**1st time:** 15 day restriction on the main account
**2nd time:** 1-1.5 month restriction on the main account
**3rd time:** Permanent but appealable restriction on the main account

**In-game Toxicity**

Each case of toxicity that is seen as going  over the line will me met with an in-game silence (and Discord mute if it occurs here). The silence times will increase exponentially and will begin at 1 hour.
